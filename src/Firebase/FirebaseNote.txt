step12. first file is project-level build.gradle and second file is app level build.gradle , you will get project-level build.gradle in android folder and you 
        you will find app level build.gradle in inside android inside app 


step13. android level build.gradle changes

buildscript {
    ext {
        buildToolsVersion = "34.0.0"
        minSdkVersion = 23
        compileSdkVersion = 34
        targetSdkVersion = 34
        ndkVersion = "26.1.10909125"
        kotlinVersion = "1.9.22"
    }
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()//add this if not added
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle")
        classpath("com.facebook.react:react-native-gradle-plugin")
        classpath("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin")
        //added code

// <project>/<app-module>/build.gradle

plugins {
    id 'com.android.application'
    // Add the Google services Gradle plugin
    id 'com.google.gms.google-services'
}

android {
    // Your existing android configuration
}

dependencies {
    // Import the Firebase BoM (Bill of Materials)
    implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:33.1.0')

    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore'
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth'
}
